<!-- Hey, Aimi Inoue, I looked at your profile page, but its really hard to see it all, so I went and created a full webpage for it, if you do use it, then just tell me if you are having any difficulty with changing stuff, I'd be more than happy to teach you about HTML. So here is the code, just copy and paste it into the normal place to change your profile page: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

            body {
                color: aliceblue;
                background-color: darkviolet;
            }
            h1 {
                text-align: center;
            }
            .center {
                display: block;
                margin-left: auto;
                margin-right: auto;
                width: 25%;
            }
            #photos {

        ---
        <p>Backstory: When she was a child her father passed away when she was about 6 years old. Her house was invaded by robbers who r*ped her. (I'm not underplaying r*pe! it's very serious! This is only for her story and purely for her *trama*) her father and mother found her and the father tried to stop them, he ended up getting shot (and died) and the mother was also shot but stayed alive. Years later (in high school) she became a bit of a s*lt. this was her way of dealing with her younger years trama.</p>
        ------
        <p>her passion is singing and dancing, one day she found a group of girls who needed another singer to join them. she joined this singing group. in the end, there are only 3 girls in the group, and the lead singer (Sonomi) is almost emotionless unless she is singing. there is the back singer/good dancer(Keiko) she is very nice and is almost friends with everyone. then there is Aimi, she is also a back singer, but she is the most talented one out of the group and almost everyone loves her (she is kinda the one girl who every girl wants to be and every boy wants to date her) the group is very famous and they perform at different stages and places almost every week. she acts very cute and acts very innocent, but she is a complete bottom and will be a *pet* to anyone, she is bisexual.</p>
