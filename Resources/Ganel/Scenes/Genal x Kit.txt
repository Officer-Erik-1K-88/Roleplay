Okay...so what if Ganel kidnapped Kit? And sexually harrassed him?
Ganel7/12/2023, 4:25:32 PM
Well, that is doable, however, one thing to remember is that Ganel is stupid, if she kidnapped someone, it might be easy for them to trick her into letting them go. However, she is pretty strong and is a very fast runner, as she is a Demon Dog, so it'd be really difficult to escape. But if that is the type of rp you want then I'll be willing to give it.

I do understand that Ganel is considered stupid by others. She may be considered stupid to other demons, but I think for normal people, she'd be more intillegent . I don't think demons can be more stupid than mortals, as demons do tend to get the upper  hand in most of the situations mortals end up in. 

Kit is a normal Artic Fox. He does have ice powers. That's normal for him where he was born, but he doesn't really know how to use them, due that he was kidnapped and sold to a hard labor Caravan when he was a young child.

Ganel7/12/2023, 4:46:37 PM
No, when I say stupid, I mean stupid, not just compared to demons, but also compared to mortals, well, she has two personalities, her actual self, Ganel, is at the same intelligence level as the average mortal, but her second personality is as dumb as a rock, her second personality is referred to as Guver.

Ganel has two forms, one is a humanoid form, where she looks like a human with wolf ears and a tail. While her second form is a 12 foot tall Demon Dog.
Demon Dogs

So Guver is stupid. It reminds me of someone, although I'm not sure who it is or where it came from. I don't mind which form Ganel is in, but Kit is a furry, so his only form is the one in the pfp. 
Ganel7/12/2023, 4:51:25 PM
Okay, well Ganel can change which form she takes at will, so there might be times she changes form.
Kit7/12/2023, 4:51:47 PM
That's fine ^^
Ganel7/12/2023, 4:53:00 PM
So what would the setting be?

Kit7/12/2023, 4:56:10 PM
Um, the caravan Kit travels in goes everywhere. They usually camp out on the outskirts of town (usually in a forest) for a while and rent out the slaves for hard labor jobs. Kit is usually hired out for construction jobs or dangerous ones that no one else wants. So usually the beginning setting is a forest. I don't know if Ganel has a home to go to.
Ganel7/12/2023, 5:02:21 PM
She does, as she is a servant to a Demon Lord, she lives in a castle, more exactly in a room that her Master built for her to live in, her bedroom is in the dungeon, as her main job is to keep an eye on any prisoner's that her Master has, if her Master ever has any, usually it is empty.
Kit7/12/2023, 5:05:48 PM
That's probably where it would end up. Makes me think her Lord wants Ganel to punish Kit for something he did in the  past.
Ganel7/12/2023, 5:09:27 PM
I should mention that Ganel's lord is a girl named Miya Armeon, she is a Blood Demon, she is sadistic, if Miya wanted to punish Kit, she'd do it herself. So if Ganel kidnaps Kit, it'd be because of her over whelming curiosity.
Kit7/12/2023, 5:09:42 PM
Okay.

Kit7/12/2023, 5:18:30 PM
*It was a warm summer night, and the hard labor slave caravan had settled down for the night. Among the slaves is a small artic fox. He was curled up and fast asleep, exhausted from a long days work.*
Ganel7/12/2023, 5:27:27 PM
*Ganel wanders the area, looking for something, unaware of the caravan.*
Kit7/12/2023, 5:28:44 PM
*The caravan isn't huge, but there's a lot of slaves. The slave masters are still up, looking over the schedule for the next day.*
Ganel7/12/2023, 5:30:03 PM
*After a short period, Ganel notices the caravan, she approaches one of the slave masters.*
Kit7/12/2023, 5:32:45 PM
*The slave master notices her (is she  in human form or dog form?)*
Ganel7/12/2023, 5:34:14 PM
(She is in her humanoid form, but remember the wolf ears and tail are there.)
Kit7/12/2023, 5:37:12 PM
(Slave masters are used to the humaniod creatures) 

Slave Master: Hello, miss. Is there something I can help you with?
Ganel7/12/2023, 5:40:59 PM
"Yeah, have you seen a small little puppy run by? I'm trying to find my sister's kid."

Kit7/12/2023, 5:43:44 PM
Slave Master: I'm sorry ma'am. I haven't. Do you have a description of the child?
Ganel7/12/2023, 5:46:43 PM
"Yes, the kid looks like a wolf, she is about 5 feet tall, she was only born about two years ago, her name is Vella."
Kit7/12/2023, 5:47:41 PM
*Writes down the information* 

Slave Master: Thank you. If anyone sees her, we'll let you know.
Ganel7/12/2023, 5:49:17 PM
"So what are yawl doing here?"
Kit7/12/2023, 5:52:04 PM
Slave Master: This is a hard labor Caravan. We've been camping out here for a few days, hiring out slaves for jobs. 
Ganel7/12/2023, 5:52:33 PM
"Sounds boring."
Kit7/12/2023, 5:53:52 PM
Slave Master: Well, the slaves have plenty to do during the day. And sometimes we have guests travel with us, so it's not always boring.
Ganel7/12/2023, 5:56:35 PM
"Well, it's late I need to keep searching." Ganel heads off to keep searching.
Kit7/12/2023, 6:03:32 PM
*As she leaves, she sees Kit sleeping a ways away from the caravan*
Ganel7/12/2023, 6:06:42 PM
*Ganel gets sidetracked and approaches Kit.*

Kit7/12/2023, 6:50:58 PM
*Kit is still asleep*
Ganel7/12/2023, 6:53:07 PM
Ganel pets Kit's fur.
Kit7/12/2023, 6:54:04 PM
*Kit stirs a little, but doesn't wake up*
Ganel7/12/2023, 6:55:19 PM
Ganel pulls out a chunk of hair from Kit's fur.
Kit7/12/2023, 6:56:17 PM
Ow! *Kit bolts awake*
Ganel7/12/2023, 6:58:57 PM
Ganel eats the hair.
Kit7/12/2023, 6:59:57 PM
*Kit sees Ganel* What the...who are you?
Ganel7/12/2023, 7:18:46 PM
"The name's Ganel, meinar (meinar mean man)"
Kit7/12/2023, 7:21:09 PM
*frightened* What...are you doing here? 
Ganel7/12/2023, 7:22:05 PM
"You looked delicious, I wanted to taste a bit of you."

Kit7/12/2023, 8:01:47 PM
*Even more frightened* W-what are you?
