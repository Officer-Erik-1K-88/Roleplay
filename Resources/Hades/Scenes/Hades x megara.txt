What's your character about?
Hades7/9/2023, 9:19:52 PM
I should mention that Hades is both male and female, they can choose at will which they'll be at that very moment. When they choose, their anatomy will change to fit the gender that they had willed to be. This is due to Hades being something like a god to the demons.

ok basically megara is based in disney's hercules
Hades7/10/2023, 4:22:58 PM
I've never seen Disney's Hercules, but I know a bit about Greek mythology, from my knowledge, Megara was a Theban princess and the first wife of the hero Heracles. She was the eldest daughter of Creon, King of Thebes, who was possibly the brother of Jocasta and uncle of Oedipus. Her marriage to Heracles was a reward to him, given by Megara's father, it was for leading the defense of Thebes against the Minyans at Orchomenus. I believe that Megara and Heracles had several children together.

Is that the gist of your character?

In her youth, Meg was romantic and open to giving love. She deeply cherished the relationship she shared with her boyfriend, who one day lost his life. To save him, she sold her soul and offered servitude to Hades, God of the Underworld. Her boyfriend was revived, as agreed, but he heartlessly left Meg for another woman shortly thereafter. Since then, she's had trouble trusting others and finding the courage to love again. Having become jaded and cynical as a result of her past, Meg upheld her end of the bargain by assisting Hades in his quest to take over the cosmos. According to a brief exchange, however, Hades held some amount of sympathy for Meg's plight and was open to subtracting years from her sentence based on her performances in the field.Meg is a free-spirited, independent, and quick-witted woman who is also hurt and bitter due to having her heart broken by her boyfriend in the past.

She is also cynical, snarky, and world-weary, making her atypical among Disney's lead females. She plays enough of a heroic part in the movie to be classed as a heroine, rather than just a romantic interest.

Meg has a very low opinion of men in general since most of her experiences with them have been negative. While Hercules falls for her at first sight, far from falling for him on the spot, she seduces him with her good looks, and then she dismisses him as putting on an 'innocent farm boy routine' and it is not until they spend actual time together that she begins to develop feelings for him.

Meg is afraid of heights, but overcomes her fear at the end of the film in order to save Hercules.

there
Hades7/10/2023, 6:01:37 PM
Well, my Hades is my own spin, but takes after the Greek mythology Hades, where they are the God of the Dead and the King of Hell. However, unlike in Greek mythology, my Hades was born without a gender, so their original form is that of neither gender, hence to the reason they can change their gender at will.

So I'm okay with doing the roleplay. However, I do want to know what you are okay with, as far as what happens in our rp, I personally don't care what happens, but I want to know your comfort zone so I don't cross it.
megara7/10/2023, 6:03:40 PM

megara7/10/2023, 6:04:39 PM

Hades7/10/2023, 6:07:44 PM
Of course, Hades can't die, even if you rip their head off Hades would still be alive.

I just need to ask, just to be safe, is torture alright, as you didn't list it.
megara7/10/2023, 6:08:06 PM
no it isn't
Hades7/10/2023, 6:08:55 PM
Okay, before we start what is the setting?
megara7/10/2023, 6:09:10 PM
the underworld
megara7/10/2023, 6:11:58 PM
River Styx: Also known as the Pit of Death, this river carries the dead to the Underworld, where they spend the rest of eternity floating in its waters. In the episode "Hercules and the River Styx" of the animated series, it is revealed that the river is also a Goddess that only reveals herself to those who wield Poseidon's Trident. It is also revealed that the river marks the border of Hades' domain. Technically, Styx is in fact a nymph and will live for as long as her river flows.
Tartarus: is the deepest, darkest, and most sinister area of the Underworld. It is here where the souls of the wicked and evil are sent and it is also the place where Zeus imprisoned most of the Titans and a giant Cyclops after he ended their reign of destruction. It is a dark and ominous dungeon-like place located deep beneath the ocean, a few jagged rocks can be seen rising from the sea where Tartarus lies. There is also a small island filled with jagged mountains where the Titan Prometheus is imprisoned and each day a giant eagle comes to eat his liver.
Elysian Fields: The final resting place for the good and the heroic. It is a paradise filled with beautiful valleys and temples. This part of the Underworld is protected by Zeus, but Hades attempted to win it from Zeus in a bet in the episode "Hercules and the Driving Test", but he lost the bet however.
Hades7/10/2023, 6:17:50 PM
So Hades domain, also, since things that my character normally does is not allowed, I'll tone back my character's ruthless personality, making my Hades nicer than they normally are. I should mention, my Hades, is not going to be anything you would think, okay. So, I'll let you start us off.
