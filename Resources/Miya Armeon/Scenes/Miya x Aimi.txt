Yeah, I'd like to start, what will be our setting?
Aimi Inoue7/9/2023, 10:51:04 AM
I have no idea-

Then, lets have the setting be Hell, we can start off in the Armeon Province, it is a small area of Hell that spans an area of about 80000 square miles, the active ruler of this domain is Miya Armeon, a Blood Demon. In the center of her domain is a castle, that's where Miya lives, she doesn't like intruders.

ok,how would aimi get into the story?
Miya Armeon7/9/2023, 11:43:03 AM
Let's say that one day, you just woke up in Hell, there's not much around, a few trees, every thing looks normal enough, except for some unfamiliar plants, but in the far off distance you see a castle, it's the only site of civilization so you naturally would go to it. At this moment your character wouldn't know that she is in Hell. I'll let you decide how you ended up there in the first place.

sounds good with me!

Lets start, one day:
Aimi wakes up in an unknown place, she sees no-one around, but there are weird plants around, though somethings look familiar, the blue sky, the green grass, even some plants look familiar. However, she doesn't know where she is...
