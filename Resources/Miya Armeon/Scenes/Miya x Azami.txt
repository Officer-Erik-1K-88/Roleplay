Azami Tigris7/10/2023, 6:27:13 PM
Hey.
Miya Armeon7/10/2023, 6:33:11 PM
Hello
Azami Tigris7/10/2023, 6:33:50 PM
Want to still role play 
Miya Armeon7/10/2023, 6:34:11 PM
Yeah.
Azami Tigris7/10/2023, 6:41:04 PM
Can we start a new one?
Miya Armeon7/10/2023, 6:41:28 PM
Sure, what are you interested in?
Azami Tigris7/10/2023, 6:44:31 PM
Still want to go along the same theme,  but more interactions between Azami and Miya.  And maybe some advancements on Delvin's end?
Azami Tigris7/10/2023, 7:01:26 PM
Am I asking too much?
Miya Armeon7/10/2023, 7:04:07 PM
No, you aren't, I'm fine with it. So does this mean we start from scratch?
Azami Tigris7/10/2023, 7:04:50 PM
If that's okay with you. 
Miya Armeon7/10/2023, 7:04:58 PM
It is.
Azami Tigris7/10/2023, 7:06:04 PM
Great.  Want me to start? We're still be in your realm.
Miya Armeon7/10/2023, 7:06:31 PM
Yeah.
Azami Tigris7/10/2023, 7:41:43 PM
Azami is looking around.  The last thing she remember is feeling a pressure in her chest before collapsing on the ground her blood mixing with the blood of her beloved Caspian Leo,  his lion, Leon,  and her dear Bengal Lotus.  Then everything went black and she woke here.  In the distance is a dark castle and Azami decides to steer clear of it as she had been imprisoned behind castle walls for much of her life.
Miya Armeon7/10/2023, 8:06:14 PM
As Azami continues to look around she sees, something moving in near by bushes.
Azami Tigris7/10/2023, 8:07:32 PM
Azami continues exploring 
Miya Armeon7/10/2023, 8:09:47 PM
(So are we just going to ignore the movement in the bushes?)
Azami Tigris7/10/2023, 8:10:44 PM
(Lotus isn't here. )
Miya Armeon7/10/2023, 8:13:40 PM
(So, there is still movement, so is your character not interested in investigating?)
Azami Tigris7/10/2023, 8:15:56 PM
Azami goes investigate a movement *
Miya Armeon7/10/2023, 8:17:14 PM
There is a person Azami has never seen before, sleeping in the bush.
Azami Tigris7/10/2023, 8:18:46 PM
Azami cautious approaches 
Miya Armeon7/10/2023, 8:21:07 PM
"Mhhmm, loba, I loge yoath," States the sleeping demon girl.
Azami Tigris7/10/2023, 8:21:48 PM
Azami blinks,  confused 
Miya Armeon7/10/2023, 8:24:18 PM
The sleeping girl grabs Azami's leg, trying to kiss it.

Azami Tigris7/10/2023, 10:09:20 PM
Azami shrieks,  trying to pull her legs away 
Azami Tigris7/10/2023, 10:46:17 PM
"Let go of my leg!"
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 3:54:20 PM
The girl wakes up, she realizes what she is doing and releases Azami, "S-sorry," she stands up, "What brings you here?"
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 3:55:28 PM
"I was...murdered along with some others and ended up here. "

Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 4:00:34 PM
"Ahh, that'll do it, so I shall welcome you, my name is Wamba (She is the older sister to Ganel), but what's your name?" Askes the Wamba.
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 4:02:15 PM
"I am Azami Tigris.  Before death I was sixth Princess of the Tigris Kingdom,  but now I'm not sure if anything about my past has any value here. "
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 4:05:50 PM
"Sure it does, who knows maybe you'll find one of your ancestors here, since many come to Hell, from one place to the next, if you die here, you'll just come right back, given you came here because you died, which you did."
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 4:07:14 PM
"I guess I was cursed if I ended up here instead of Paradise. " Azami sighs 
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 4:08:55 PM
"One can only come to Hell through death if they have sinned a sin that God can't forgive or they made a contract with a demon."
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 4:13:27 PM
Azami thinks back on her sixteen years of life.  "I will never know if God would punish me for sneaking out of the castle every full moon and my birthday.  My own parents kept me locked up in the castle saying it was to protect me."
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 4:19:55 PM
"Definitely not, that is not a sin, I'm talking about something that is as bad as or worse that cold blooded murder, God is very forgiving, they don't like it when beings enter Hell, so there are four domains after death, the first, the one that all go to after death is limbo, that is where you wait for your sentence, most forget what happens there. The second is Heaven, that is where only the things that were good go. The third is referred to as purgatory, that is better than Hell, only the petty sins go there. Then there is the fourth, the one, it's only for those that God will never forgive, meaning God sees you as an enemy."
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 4:21:44 PM
"I don't understand why,  but I must accept that I shall never enter the gates of heaven. "
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 4:24:26 PM
"Don't say that, it's still possible, you just have to win the heart of an archangel, then and only then would someone from Hell be able to go to Heaven, but that task is near impossible, you'd have better luck with fucking Hades than making an archangel fall in love with you."
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 4:25:33 PM
Azami shivers at the mention of Hades.  "Who runs this Providence?"
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 4:27:18 PM
"Who? That would be Miya Armeon, she lives over there in that castle, my little sister works for Miya, no, it's more like she is Miya's slave."
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 4:28:10 PM
Azami looks at the castle.  "She must know about someone dropping 
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 4:28:55 PM
into her realm. I've been trying to stay away from the castle.  I don't want to be p
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 4:29:26 PM
Imprisonment in a third time."
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 4:31:33 PM
"Then don't go, Miya has no reason to respond to every person that appears in her territory, mind you, that would be about 100 entities per day."

Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 4:34:06 PM
Azami sighs.  She has no idea what to do.  She doubt her, with long ebony hair and vibrant aquamarine eyes,  could recieve the love of an archangel. "I 'm
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 4:34:17 PM
so lost "
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 4:40:49 PM
"Well, I need to get going, I don't want to keep Hades waiting any longer, so see ya later."
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 4:41:57 PM
Azami watches dismsmayed as Wamba leaves. 
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 4:52:29 PM
As Wamba leaves, she transforms into a 24 foot tall Demon Dog (About twice the size of Ganel when she is in her Demon Dog form.), she seems to be able to run at ridiculously fast speeds as she quickly leaves Azami's field of view.
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 4:54:34 PM
Azami sits down,  wondering if she should go to the castle,  or just keep wandering.
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 4:55:49 PM
As Azami is sitting and thinking, she sees a box fall from the sky.
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 4:56:49 PM
Azami catches the boy. She carefully examines ir.
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 5:00:20 PM
The box looks to be about 2 square feet, it looks to be made out of metal, with a latch on it, it has an aura of danger, but to contradict that feeling, written on the box are the words, "Help me." The box's latch is locked.

Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 5:01:44 PM
"What a curious box  "
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 5:03:15 PM
The box gently shakes, Azami can hear what sounds lick something kicking metal, the sound is coming from the box.
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 5:05:52 PM
Azami pulls out two of her hair pins and picks at the lock. 
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 5:13:17 PM
The latch comes unlocked. 
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 5:32:48 PM
Azami opens the boy carefully. 
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 6:24:02 PM
In the box is a young girl, she looks to be human, she looks to be a high schooler, she asks, "W-who are you?"
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 6:25:00 PM
"My name is Azami Tigris.  Are you alright?"
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 6:29:27 PM
"Y-yes, it's nice to met you," The girl stands up, "I am Whilla, where am I? The last thing I remember is being executed by the IDPF."
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 6:31:19 PM
"You're in a providence of Hell. It's not too bad here...as far as Incsn say. *
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 6:32:51 PM
"So, ahh, I'm in Hell, I never thought I'd end up here, well seems like I've been fucked over once again by the IDPF."
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 6:34:20 PM
"Who are they?"
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 6:34:50 PM
"You wanna hear about the IDPF?"
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 6:36:05 PM
"I'm getting the feeling we're not from the same timeline,  or dimension even.  So,  I don't know the IDPF."
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 6:36:56 PM
"Though I would think PF stands for 'Police Force '."
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 6:40:56 PM
"Well, the IDPF stands for the Interdimensional Police Force, they keep peace among the multiverse, I used to work for them, but I ended up breaking the number one rule; Never betray the force, always help your fellow officers. I ended up disobeying my superiors."
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 6:43:06 PM
"Excuse me for prying,  but may I inquire as to how you betrayed them?"
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 6:45:00 PM
"Ohh, I just helped a known criminal escape Interdimensional prison, they where sentenced to 1486 years of imprisonment, hence why I was executed."

Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 6:48:20 PM
"I guess you either thought he was innocent or his crimson was a  misdemeanor."
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 6:52:53 PM
"No, they differently deserved to be in prison, her crime was destroying a universe, however, she was my lover, I just couldn't bare seeing her rot away in that prison, so I broke her out, but we were caught, she was executed right next to me, so maybe she is here too, somewhere."
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 6:57:47 PM
"I think she maybe in a different providence,  based on the enormity of her crime. What you did was out of love more or less, and therefore you have ended up here. "
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 7:00:44 PM
"Hmm, maybe it was that, but it could also because I cheated death itself before became the girl named Whilla, something known as a forced reincarnation you could call it, but I digress." Whilla states.
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 7:00:49 PM
"The Vergal Box (The box that Whilla was in) was opened? No sinner has come in one of those in a long time," States Miya as she sits on her throne, she stands up, "Maybe I shall check it out."
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 7:07:07 PM
"So,  you cheated death...must've been hard to disappear "
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 7:08:14 PM
"What do you mean by 'must've been hard to disappear'?" Asks Whilla.
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 7:09:07 PM
"Well,  I was a princess.  It would be hard to fake my death. "
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 7:10:55 PM
"I didn't face my death, I actually died you can't reincarnate without dyeing, but I cheated death because I got a second life, after all, before I was Whilla I was a man, a sleazed bag of a man at that."
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 7:20:02 PM
"Oh....I guess that makes sense,  more or less.  I was supposed to be the second coming of one of my ancestors from a thousand years ago. There was even a prochecy received by the prophets shortly after I was born."
Miya Armeon7/11/2023, 7:21:21 PM
"Well, unlike most reincarnations, when you force it, then you get to keep the memories of your past life."
Azami Tigris7/11/2023, 7:22:56 PM
"I  guess You're right.  I don't remember anything from my ancestor, except that she was betrayed and executed by her true love. "


Miya Armeon7/12/2023, 4:01:22 PM
"Ahh, okay," Says Whilla, "Let's get going."
Miya Armeon7/12/2023, 4:01:52 PM
Miya sets out to investigate.
Azami Tigris7/12/2023, 6:04:47 PM
Azami senses something in the sky and looks up, but doesn't see anything.  "I'm glad we're trapped here together.  I wouldn't like being alone. "
Miya Armeon7/12/2023, 6:08:12 PM
"Well, okay, so where shall we go?" Asks Whilla.
Azami Tigris7/12/2023, 6:09:27 PM
Azami looks at the barren landscape "Anywhere I guess. " She continues to scare the sky and landscape. 
Miya Armeon7/12/2023, 6:13:37 PM
Whilla gets out of the box, tripping over the edge and falling.
Azami Tigris7/12/2023, 6:14:12 PM
Azami kneels besides her.  "Are you alright?"
Miya Armeon7/12/2023, 6:50:00 PM
"Ahh, I should be fine," Whilla get up, using Azami's shoulder to help.
Azami Tigris7/12/2023, 6:52:20 PM
Azami smiles  "I hope so...I don't know much about medicine in this realm. "
Miya Armeon7/12/2023, 7:13:42 PM
Whilla grabs Azami's arm, "Let's take a walk."
Azami Tigris7/12/2023, 7:19:57 PM
Azami smiles "Alright. "
Miya Armeon7/12/2023, 7:20:51 PM
As Whilla and Azami go for a walk, once they were away from the box, Miya arrives at the box.

Azami Tigris7/12/2023, 7:41:33 PM
Azami is enjoying time with Whilla, despite feeling watched.
Azami Tigris7/12/2023, 7:42:32 PM
Azami enjoys Whilla's company, but still feels like they're being watched. 
Miya Armeon7/12/2023, 7:43:13 PM
Miya investigates the box.
Azami Tigris7/12/2023, 8:22:48 PM
A demon dog is sniffing around the boy. He has picked up two different scenes.
Miya Armeon7/12/2023, 8:28:45 PM
(I gotta ask, why are you typing boy instead of box? since it's a box.)
Azami Tigris7/12/2023, 8:30:20 PM
(Stupid autocorrect. )
Miya Armeon7/12/2023, 8:33:14 PM
(Ahh, okay.)

The Demon Dog, starts following the scents.
Azami Tigris7/12/2023, 8:35:09 PM
Azami and Whilla haven't gone far when they hear a demonic, eerie Howl.
