I came up with idea. So, your OC (you can choose) is looking for a slave. She (I think most of your characters are female) is looking through a black market and meets a young, nameless sugar glider. She buys him and takes him home. From there it's improv.

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/9/2023 7:33 PM
Okay. I've just thought of the perfect character that I have; her name is Peanut, and she is a humanoid statue creature, basically, she looks like a normal human, but she feels like a statue and she is as sturdy as a statue. She has all the qualities of a human and a statue.

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/9/2023 7:40 PM
Let's start off with Peanut walking through the black market...
Peanut is walking through a hidden part of town, where the lowest of the low reside, where one can buy almost anything their heart desires, from drugs to others' lives, you can find it here, in the black market, she seems to just be looking through the tents set up, she doesn't look interested in anything they have to offer, but in the corner of her eye, Peanut sees something...

Peaches24 — 8/9/2023 8:18 PM
One of the tents is selling slaves. The slaves weren't a specific type, one could do whatever they wanted with their slave. One of the slaves was a sugar glider, white with purple markings. He seemed to be afraid of the people looking at him.

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/9/2023 9:07 PM
Peanut walks over to the slave trader's tent; she looks at the slaves, as she looks she stops in front of the sugar glider. She has this sinisterly dark stare, it feels as if her stare could kill, it's pure emptiness. "You look pretty," Peanut emotionlessly says.

Peaches24 — 8/9/2023 9:08 PM
The sugar glider flinches, frightened.  One of the slave traders notices Peanut looking at the sugar glider.

"May I help you, miss?"

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/9/2023 9:10 PM
"Yes, how much does this thing go for?" Asks Peanut, even the slave trader feels frightened by Peanut's aura.

Peaches24 — 8/9/2023 9:14 PM
"Um....about...1,000, miss. We do offer discounts as well." He's frightened, but it trying not to show it.

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/9/2023 9:24 PM
"It's cheap, but would my beloved approve of the purchase?" Peanut questioned herself, "Ahh, fuck it."
Directed to the slave trader, "I'd like to buy it."

Peaches24 — 8/9/2023 9:27 PM
"Of course, miss. Follow me, and we'll fill out the paperwork."

The sugar glider was frightened. What did this woman want with him?

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/9/2023 9:29 PM
Peanut follows the slave trader.

Peaches24 — 8/9/2023 9:37 PM
The nameless sugar glider listens as they discuss payment and ownership.

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/9/2023 9:41 PM
Peanut agrees with it, fills out the paperwork, and pays in full.

Peaches24 — 8/9/2023 9:42 PM
"Thank you so much miss. I hope our slave treats you with the utmost respect."

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/9/2023 9:45 PM
Peanut goes over to the sugar glider, "I'm gonna call you Pip." She then puts her hand on his head, petting him.

Peaches24 — 8/9/2023 9:48 PM
The sugar glider is confused. She seems nice enough, but she could also be scary, as when she first saw him. Pip wasn't sure what to think

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/9/2023 9:53 PM
Peanut then picks Pip up.

Peaches24 — 8/9/2023 10:06 PM
"-!" Pip was not expecting to be picked up.

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/9/2023 10:08 PM
Peanut starts walking with him in her arms.

Peaches24 — 8/9/2023 10:17 PM
"..." Pip stays silent, but feels safe in Peanut's embrace.

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 5:02 AM
Eventually, Peanut and Pip reach Peanut's home, they enter, and Peanut sets Pip down.

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 12:34 PM
Pip looks around the home. It looks cozy enough. Pip wasn't sure what to expect, but since Peanut bought him, she hadn't really done much except bring him here. Pip was sure he'd be given a list of chores, but he was used to that.

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 1:30 PM
Peanut walks into a closet and starts rummaging around, looking for something.

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 1:36 PM
"???"
[1:36 PM]
Pip watches in curiosity

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 1:39 PM
When Peanut comes out she is holding a purple collar.

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 1:43 PM
"-?!" Pip has no idea what the purple collar is for, or why he needs it

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 1:51 PM
Peanut approaches Pip, she attempts to put the collar on Pip (Is she successful?). On a closer inspection of the collar, something seems off about it, it's wet, slimy, and oddly warm to the touch, also it twitches a bit as it touches Pip's neck.

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 2:06 PM
(She is) Pip struggles to get the collar off; it seems to be alive or something, as it's not a normal collar

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 2:17 PM
Peanut puts her hand on Pip's head, "Calm down, you won't be able to get this Wambala off, only me or my beloved can, that's what I love about Wambala collars. You'll get used to it."

(Something to note: A Wambala collar is a collar that is alive, only the masters of the collar can make it release, it's a very rare thing to use. The Wambala does no harm to the wearer. The Wambala's main diet consists of flees and ticks.)

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 2:23 PM
Pip still doesn't know what the collar is for, but since he won't be able to get the Wambala off, he leaves it alone.

"Um...why a Wambala? What do I need it for?"

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 2:28 PM
"The collar is so I won't lose track of you," Peanut says, "Also it'll help me to convince my lover to keep you!"

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 2:31 PM
"Okay...?"

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 2:40 PM
"Any how, go clean the kitchen and dinning room, also while your at it, wash the dishes," Peanut commands Pip with a sweetly harsh tone.

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 2:41 PM
Pip knew this would happen. Pip gets up and starts on the dishes. He might as well do those done before he starts cleaning.

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 2:49 PM
While Pip cleans Peanut goes and changes into her work clothes.

(Peanut works the night shift, she works for a secret organization that deals with the strange and anomalous things of the world, things that shouldn't exist but do.)

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 3:03 PM
(Cool)

After Pip does the dishes, he begins to clean the kitchen.

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 4:41 PM
Once Peanut finished changing, she quickly made it to the front door and leaned against a wall, waiting.

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 4:57 PM
Pip sees her waiting. He finishes cleaning before approaching her. "Is everything alright?"

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 5:02 PM
"Yeah, just waiting for my lover to come home," Peanut states.

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 5:04 PM
"Um....who is your lover?"

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 5:08 PM
"My lover is this wonderfully beautiful person, her name is Peach, and she should be home any minute," Peanut states, "If you are finished cleaning, go down to the basement and organize it, that'll keep you busy for a while, you'll also use the bedroom down there as yours, it's quite messy though."

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 5:11 PM
"Yes ma'am." Pip goes down to the basement to clean and organize it.

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 5:28 PM
As Pip goes down Peach walks through the front door, Peanut greet each other, they kiss, then they say their goodbyes, and Peanut then leaves for work.

After Peanut left, Peach got some clothes and went to take a shower.

When Pip goes into the basement, the first thing he sees is a door that says "GUN VAULT" on it; that door is locked. To the left of the vault is a large storage area; it is really unorganized. To the right of the vault is a set of 6 doors: one is a bedroom, another is a cloth washing room, another is a furnace and boiler room, another is a bathroom, another is a small lab, and the final room looks to be some sort of surveillance/communication room and office space (Pretty much a place for Peanut to work from home.).

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 5:46 PM
Pip starts to organize the storage area.

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 6:13 PM
As Pip organizes the storage area, he spots a box that has the biohazard symbol on it; it looks to be unlocked but is latched.

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 6:18 PM
"What's this?" Pip isn't sure what to do with the box. It has the biohazard symbol, which means he probably shouldn't pick it up. And why is it unlocked? If it's a hazard, shouldn't it be locked up safely?

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 6:21 PM
On a closer inspection of the box, there is a note on it saying "broken".

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 6:35 PM
"Broken?" Pip is curious, but is afriad to tamper with the box. Instead, he decides to continue organizing, leaving the biohazard box alone.

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 6:39 PM
The biohazard box gets in the way at some point in the organizing.

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 6:44 PM
Pip doesn't know what to do. He could just move the box as long as he doesn't get any of the box anywhere...Pip picked up the box and set it where it wouldn't get in the way, he'd deal with it after he finished organizing.

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 6:49 PM
When Pip moved the biohazard box, he noticed a rattling sound in it, like something was rolling around in it.

As he continued to organize, he found an old can of corn, it is unopened but is about 10 years out of date, and the can looks to be in perfect condition.

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 6:52 PM
"Why is there a can of corn 10 years out of date?" Pip asked himself. He set the corn aside, maybe that was what was in the boihazard box, and returned to organizing. (edited)

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 6:55 PM
As he continues organizing he comes across a box with some sort of mushroom growing on it, in the box are just 10 empty flasks.

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 8:52 PM
"??? This is getting wierd..."

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 8:59 PM
Other than that, Pip finds nothing else of interest in his organizing; at least out of the boxes that were openable, there were a few that were locked.

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 9:03 PM
Pip finishes organizing, and turns his attention back to the biohazard box. "I wonder what's in here..."

Officer Erik 1K-88 — 8/10/2023 9:07 PM
When Pip opens the biohazard box he finds one thing, a glass rod filled with some sort of liquid, on the tube is just the single word "DANGEROUS". The liquid is dark blue. The glass tube doesn't seem to be openable, it seems like the glass is about 2 inches thick with only 4 ounces of liquid in the tube.

Peaches24 — 8/10/2023 9:08 PM
"Dangerous...."
